This is a CSS style to make Github use the colors from the everforest theme.\
[Theory](https://github.com/Theory-of-Everything/) had already made one before me which can be found ![here](https://github.com/Theory-of-Everything/everforest-userstyles-css) but I disliked parts of it so I decided to make my own.
# Installing
To use it you can use an exchange such as stylus(![firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search), ![chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)) and then just copy the contents of `styles.css` into a style for Github.
